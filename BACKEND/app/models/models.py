    Data model for API error responses.
    
    Whenever the API encounters an error, be it a user-made error, a server error, or any other type of error,
    it will respond with this model. Having a standardized error response format ensures that clients can
    easily understand and handle errors consistently. The `detail` attribute provides a descriptive message 
    about the specific error, aiding in debugging and issue resolution.
